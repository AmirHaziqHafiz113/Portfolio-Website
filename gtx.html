                    <p>Ahhhh, remember those days back in few years where I enjoying my not so stressful life of secondary school in SMK Kajang Utama. Those were some of the memorable days during. However, Today I will be going through chronological order
                        about my education life.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Kindergarten</h2>
                    <p>My first kindergarten started at Intellectual Kindergarten where I was taught on speaking Mandarin (Which I can't remember anything), English and dancing class. That was also one of the moment where I was introduced to multi-cultural
                        tradition with indian and chinese friends.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I was going to KAFA. An Islamic kindergarten aimed to make sure that all Muslims child are educated in Islamic teachings. Unfortunately, I don't have enough memory of the place due to my nomadic condition to travel
                        between two home everyday.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Primary School</h2>
                    <p>During my primary school, I studied at SK Seri Cheras. I do not have sweet memories regarding the place since I was constantly bullied by my classmate. Adding fire to the wound, that is also the time where my father has passed away.</p>
                    <p>Entering second year, i was transferred to SK Sri Al-Amin Bangi which is also an Islamic school. I studies there but my performance in academic is not very good since I was being too lazy to study at the time. I studied there for 2
                        years only.</p><img class="img-fluid" src="files/img/1941515_786925768024686_1713758466024186375_o.jpg" style="width: 149px;margin-left: 313px;">
                    <p>When my age entered 10 years old a.k.a. year 4 of primary school, I studied at SK Kajang Utama with some wonderful friends and teachers. Some of my teachers teach me until I was able to be a master at mathematics. At the time, I become
                        more focused on my UPSR and my curiculum activities. I was appointed as the school representative in Al-Quran memorization competition.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Secondary School</h2>
                    <p>With my excellent result, I was accepted as a high school student and become a hostel resident of the school. First year of being a resident, I cry a lot because of my crybaby behavior and homesick. However as years goes on, I adapt
                        to the situation and improve myself to become a better person that can be independent. During that time, I applied to be the school prefect (Which I successfully achieved) and do my task dutifully.&nbsp; Below is the picture of
                        my batch of being a prefect in High School Kajang (Try find me if you can).</p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="files/img/10650029_10153171528610719_5603652649135940031_n.jpg" style="width: 460px;margin-left: 144px;"></a><span class="caption text-muted">To fully explore and take advantage, that is what life is...</span>
                    <p>In 2016, I transferred to SMK Kajang Utama, the closest school near to my home. Everyday, I would cycle myself toward the school and attend class in the morning. I was also appointed as prefect during my time learning there. I choose
                        accounting stream (which is very difficult) as one of the option provided. I learn hard for my SPM which it finally paid off with 4As and 5Bs.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">University</h2>
                    <p>And now, here I am, a proud student of UITM Rembau in the faculty of Information Management. I'm currently at my last semester and set to finish my last semester at jan-feb 2021.&nbsp;</p>
